    "## Description\n",
    "In the final project, you will create a 'bot' to play the game of [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) against the dealer. To make things more interesting and encourage some friendly competition, I will compile any submissions daily beginning 30 April and update a leaderboard of the top 10 submissions that will be posted on Teams. More on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackjack is a common card game in which a player competes against the dealer. The hand with the highest point total without going over 21 wins the hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><b>This is in no way an endorsement of gambling - gambling involves risk and, over time, the odds favor the house</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to program a strategy to maximize the proportion of hands won and the return on your wager. Blackjack's simple rules makes it an ideal game to test implementing different strategies from simple rules-based decisions to artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Card Point Values\n",
    "- Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value\n",
    "- The Jack, Queen, and King are worth ten points\n",
    "- The Ace is worth either one or eleven points\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Game Play\n",
    "Typically, Blackjack is played with between one and eight decks of cards which is referred to as a 'shoe'. We will use **eight** decks in the shoe. From the shoe, the player is dealt one card face up, the dealer receives one card face up, the player is dealt a second card face up, and the dealer receives one final card face down. The player plays first and decides whether to 'stand' and keep their current hand value or 'hit' and receive another card to increase their hand value. The player can take as many hits as they would like If their hand value exceeds 21, then they have 'busted' and the dealer automatically wins. After the player completes their turn, the dealer then takes a turn follow a set of pre-defined rules:\n",
    "- The dealer must hit on 16 and below\n",
    "- The dealer must stand on 17 and higher with the below exception\n",
    "- The dealer must hit on a 'soft' 17, meaning they have an Ace so the hand could be either 7 or 17\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note, a hand is only 'soft' if it contains an Ace and the hand value could be two different values that are both less than or equal to 21. A hand of Ace-five is 'soft' because it could be 16 or 6; whereas, a hand of Ace-five-six is not 'soft' because it can only be 12 (22 and above automatically loses so there is no choice).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The game continues playing more hands in this same way until there are too few cards remaining in the shoe. To ensure a hand does not run out of cards, the dealer typically places a cut with around one-quarter of the shoe remaining. No new hands begin after the cut card appears. For example, if the cut card is placed between the 40th and 41st cards in a shoe with a single deck, then no new hands would begin after the 40th card was dealt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Optional Special Cases\n",
    "In most games, the player has the option to 'split' a hand into two separate bets if their initial two cards are the same. Additionally, a player usually has the option to 'double down' which doubles their initial bet, but they must take one and only one additional card.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "I will simulate your strategy thousands of times in order to calculate accurate measurements of the statistics of interest: proportion of hands won and average winnings per hand.\n",
    "1. You must name your Python script `blackjack.py`\n",
    "2. You must define a function named `player_action` that I will call in order to get your play:\n",
    "    * the first parameter accepts as an argument a list of cards that represent the player's hand (your hand)\n",
    "    * the second parameter accepts as an argument a value that represents the dealer's up card\n",
    "    * the third parameter accepts as an argument a list of all cards that have been played in the current shoe previous to the current hand\n",
    "    * the function will return one of the following strings: 'hit', 'stand', 'split', or 'double'\n",
    "3. You must define a function named `wager` that I will call before beginning a hand to get your wager for the hand:\n",
    "    * the function has one parameter that accepts as an argument a list of all cards that have been played in the current shoe previous to the current hand\n",
    "    * the function will return a number between 1 and 100, inclusive (integer or float)\n",
    "\n",
    "In my simulation, \n",
    "* Cards will be represented with the integers 2 through 10, and the strings 'J', 'Q', 'K', and 'A'\n",
    "* I will use eight decks to create the shoe (which will then be simulated 1000 times)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Otherwise, you are free to try anything with the following **exception**:\n",
    "* do not simply find a [table on the internet](https://www.mrgreen.com/en/blackjack/strategies/blackjack-odds) with the odds of winning and create a container to lookup what to do in each scenario; instead, program the logic to create the lookup table by simulating the game many times just like I am with your strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will work correctly and you will win approximately 38% of all hands. As a result, your goal is to develop a strategy that consistently wins more than 38% of hands.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def player_action(player_hand, dealer_card, played_cards):\n",
    "    return 'stand'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def wager(played_cards):\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some ideas to consider:\n",
    "1. Start off by implementing this [simple human strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bRxpVx677k) in reverse order (bottom to top on the video slide) to eventually get to 43% winning percentage\n",
    "2. Consider simulating Blackjack many times to populate a [transition matrix](https://www.dummies.com/education/math/use-transition-matrices/) where the rows are the state you are currently in, the columns the state you transition to, and the value is the probability of that event occuring. For example, what is the probability that you transition from a total hand value of 4 to a total hand value of 6. Or, what is the probability the dealer transitions from an up card of 2 to a final hand value of 17. This [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-weather-with-markov-chains-a34735f0c4df) describes creating a probability transition matrix to predict tomorrow's weather based on today's weather\n",
    "3. Consider implementing a heuristic, like a [genetic algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/winning-blackjack-using-machine-learning-681d924f197c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: you should not simulate blackjack many times to determine your move within `player_action`, but rather do that once when the module is imported and use the result to inform your decision each time `player_action` is called. We will stop your code execution if it takes longer than 10 minutes to run. If your solution legitimately takes longer than 10 minutes, then please let us know.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Test Simulation\n",
    "We have provided a Python module called `blackjack_test` that you may use to test your solution. This module is not a Python script; instead, it is a compiled Python script so it has the extension '.cpython-37.pyc'. It is bytecode in order to make importing and running the code faster. It must be saved in the same folder as your `blackjack` script. This is what we will use to calculate the statistics of interest for your solution. Follow these steps to run the module:\n",
    "* create a Final Project folder (e.g. C:\\Users\\c20rex.yee\\Documents\\CS212\\Final')\n",
    "* save the `blackjack_test.cpython-37.pyc` file in the same location as your `blackjack.py` script\n",
    "* copy the path to this directory (e.g. 'C:\\Users\\c20rex.yee\\Documents\\CS212\\Final')\n",
    "* open Anaconda Prompt and change to this directory by typing (change to your file path): `cd C:\\Users\\c20rex.yee\\Documents\\CS212\\Final`\n",
    "* run the module by typing: `python blackjack_test.cpython-37.pyc`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above code, you should see the output similar to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Win percentage: 38.819%\n",
    "Tie percentage: 4.804%\n",
    "Avg winnings per hand: -0.154 units\n",
    "Total rounds: 60725\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Due @ 2300 on 26 April**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project Design document serves two purposes:\n",
    "1. It will help  you plan the design and implementation of your project\n",
    "2. It will allow your instructor to review your project\n",
    "\n",
    "The design should contain these basic components:\n",
    "* Program purpose and objectives; 3-5 sentence description\n",
    "* Detailed list of requirements your program must satisfy to meet objectives\n",
    "* List and description of required functions, including parameters\n",
    "* Description of all inputs and outputs\n",
    "* Testing procedures to ensure your program works as intended\n",
    "\n",
    "The project design should be aspirational in nature in that it includes more requirements than you think you can complete. However, those requirements should be decomposed sufficiently so that you can develop your program incrementally. As a result, you should be able to develop and test each requirement fully prior to moving on to the next. In this way, you will always have something to show for your work and you can explain what impeded your progress and what it would take to complete. Remember, your grade will be based on both the quality and scope of your project so you will not be penalized for identifying more requirements than was possible.\n",
